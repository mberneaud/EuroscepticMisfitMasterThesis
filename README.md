# Eurosceptic Misfit Master Thesis
Here, data collection and analysis for my master thesis examining the 'Eurosceptic Misfit' between popular levels of Euroscepticism and electoral support for Eurosceptic parties in the EU will be published.

This is a work in progress, hence the present information is rudimentary at best right now, but will continue to grow as time goes on.

## Information on data used
The data used in my research as collected under the aegis of the [European Election Studies](http://eeshomepage.net/) and is available through the [Data Archive of GESIS](http://www.gesis.org/home/) â€“ Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences. Data from GESIS is only available after prior registration on the website and is free for most non-commercial research uses. Because of this, data files are excluded from this repo. However, a detailed overview of the data used can be found in [this Markdown file](./Analysis/Data/DataUsed.md).
