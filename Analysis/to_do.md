# To-do of data cleaning and data merging for my analysis

#### European national parties data
1. ~~Merging Euromanifesto data in with data for party vote shares~~
2. Creating a "eurosceptic.party" dummy variable

#### Data on attitudes of European voters
1. ~~Decide on which operational definition to use~~
   * ~~has to be available in all Eurobarometers~~ Used instrumental EUS and general EUS, as they were the only one available in appropriate Eurobarometers
2. ~~Download all the Eurobarometer data from GESIS~~
   * ~~Document all data sources, at least links~~
3. ~~Possible use attitudes from EES data~~
4. ~~Calculate national levels of Euroscepticism for all MS~~
   * Done from Eurobarometer data

#### National contextual factors
1. Get data on recipient / contributor status for EU Member States
2. Calculate polarisation index for countries in the sample, use EU parties polarisa
