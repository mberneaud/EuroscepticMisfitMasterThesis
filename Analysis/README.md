# Readme for the Analysis sub-folder of my repo
In this folder, I have saved all the steps along my statistical analysis as part of my Master thesis. I have tried to keep stuff as reproducible as possible, but not all of the data can be freely accessed and directly downloaded into R. Because of that, I have listed all the data I used in this analysis in a [central Markdown](./data_used.md).
This file contains links to all the data that I used in my analysis and where I placed the files for my analysis and where to integrate them into the repo structure in order to provide reproducibility.

_Disclaimer: As this is a work in progress, the central file is bound to be incomplete and missing crucial steps. Moreover, files are not yet correctly linked together._
